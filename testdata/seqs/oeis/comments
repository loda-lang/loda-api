  In (J. H. Conway, Heiko Dietrich and E. A. O'Brien, 2008), a(n) is called the "group number of n", denoted by gnu(n), and the first occurrence of k is called the "minimal order attaining k", denoted by moa(k) (see A046057). - _Daniel Forgues_, Feb 15 2017
  It is conjectured in (J. H. Conway, Heiko Dietrich and E. A. O'Brien, 2008) that the sequence n -> a(n) -> a(a(n)) = a^2(n) -> a(a(a(n))) = a^3(n) -> ... -> consists ultimately of 1s, where a(n), denoted by gnu(n), is called the "group number of n". - _Muniru A Asiru_, Nov 19 2017
  MacHale (2020) shows that there are infinitely many values of n for which there are more groups than rings of that order (cf. A027623). He gives n = 36355 as an example. It would be nice to have enough values of n to create an OEIS entry for them. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 02 2021

  Historical note: the sequence might be better called the Oldenburger-Kolakoski sequence, since it was discussed by Rufus Oldenburger in 1939; see links. - _Clark Kimberling_, Dec 06 2012.  However, to avoid confusion, this sequence will be known in the OEIS as the Kolakoski sequence. It is undesirable to have some entries refer to the Oldenburger-Kolakoski sequence and others to the Kolakoski sequence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 22 2017
  If the word has odd length, then the last letter is ignored.
  If we map 1 to +1 and 2 to -1, then the mapped sequence would have a [conjectured] mean of 0, since the Kolakoski sequence is [conjectured] to have an equal density (1/2) of 1s and 2s. For the partial sums of this mapped sequence, see A088568. - _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 08 2015
  It is an unsolved problem to show that the density of 1's is equal to 1/2.
  It was noted by me in 1979 in the Bordeaux seminar on number theory that (a(n+1)) is fixed point of the 2-block substitution 11 -> 21, 12 -> 211, 21 -> 221,  22 -> 2211. (End)
  Kupin and Rowland write: We use a method of Goulden and Jackson to bound freq_1(K), the limiting frequency of 1 in the Kolakoski word K. We prove that |freq_1(K) - 1/2| <= 17/762, assuming the limit exists and establish the semirigorous bound |freq_1(K) - 1/2| <= 1/46. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Sep 16 2008
  Looking at the plot for A088568, it seems that although the asymptotic densities of 1s and 2s appear to be 1/2, there might be a bias in favor of the 2s. I.e., D(1) = 1/2 - O(log(n)/n), D(2) = 1/2 + O(log(n)/n). - _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 11 2015
  Named after the American artist and recreational mathematician William George Kolakoski (1944-1997). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 17 2021
  The sequence does not contain words of the form ababa, because this would imply the impossible 111 (1 b, 1 a, 1 b) somewhere before. This demonstrates the conjecture made by _Jon Perry_: more than 6 1's or 6 2's in a word of 10 would necessitate something like aabaabaaba, which would imply the impossible 12121 before (word aabaababaa is also impossible because of ababa). The remark on the sextuplets below even shows that the number of 1's in any 9-tuplet is always 4 or 5.
  The sequence is cubefree and all square subwords have lengths which are one of 2, 4, 6, 18 and 54 (see A294447) [Carpi, 1994].
  There are only 6 triples that appear in the sequence (112, 121, 122, 211, 212 and 221); and by the preceding argument, only 18 sextuplets: the 6 double triples (112112, etc.); 112122, 112212, 121122, 121221, 211212, and 211221; and those obtained by reversing the order of the triples (122112, etc.). Regarding the density of 1's in the sequence, these 12 sextuplets all have a density 1/2 of 1's, and the 6 double triples all lead to a word with this exact density after transformation by the Kolakoski rules, for example: 112112 -> 12112122 (4 1's/8); this is because the second triple reverses the numbers of 1's and 2's generated by the first triple. Therefore, the sequence can be split into the double triples on one side, a part whose transformation (which is in the sequence) has a density of 1's of 1/2; and a part with the other sextuplets, which has directly the same density of 1's. (End)

A000003: Also, when setting K3(x)=hypergeom([1/3,2/3],[1], x^3) and solving for x such that K3((1-x^3)^(1/3))/K3(x)==sqrt(n), then the degree of the minimal polynomial of x^3 is every third term of this sequence, or so it seems. (End)
  From _Joerg Arndt_, Sep 02 2008: (Start)
  It seems that 2*a(n) gives the degree of the minimal polynomial of (k_n)^2 where k_n is the n-th singular value, i.e., K(sqrt(1-k_n^2))/K(k_n)==sqrt(n) (and K is the elliptic integral of the first kind: K(x) := hypergeom([1/2,1/2],[1], x^2)).

Example: a(6) = 4 = (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2) dot (2, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1) = (2, -1, 0, -2, 3, 2) = 4. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 26 2009
  For odd n, this is the number of partitions of n into consecutive integers. Proof: For n = 1, clearly true. For n = 2k + 1, k >= 1, map each (necessarily odd) divisor to such a partition as follows: For 1 and n, map k + (k+1) and n, respectively. For any remaining divisor d <= sqrt(n), map (n/d - (d-1)/2) + ... + (n/d - 1) + (n/d) + (n/d + 1) + ... + (n/d + (d-1)/2) {i.e., n/d plus (d-1)/2 pairs each summing to 2n/d}. For any remaining divisor d > sqrt(n), map ((d-1)/2 - (n/d - 1)) + ... + ((d-1)/2 - 1) + (d-1)/2 + (d+1)/2 + ((d+1)/2 + 1) + ... + ((d+1)/2 + (n/d - 1)) {i.e., n/d pairs each summing to d}. As all such partitions must be of one of the above forms, the 1-to-1 correspondence and proof is complete. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Apr 20 2008

  If the canonical factorization of n into prime powers is Product p^e(p) then d(n) = Product (e(p) + 1). More generally, for k > 0, sigma_k(n) = Product_p ((p^((e(p)+1)*k))-1)/(p^k-1) is the sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of n.
  Let k(n) = log d(n)*log log n/(log 2 * log n), then lim sup k(n) = 1 (Hardy and Wright, Chapter 18, Theorem 317) and k(n) <= k(6983776800) = 1.537939... (the constant A280235) for every n (Nicolas and Robin, 1983).

  Sum_{d|n} phi(d)*h(n/d) = Sum_{k=1..n} h(gcd(n,k)) [see P. H. van der Kamp link] = Sum_{d|n} h(d)*phi(n/d) = Sum_{k=1..n} h(n/gcd(n,k))*phi(gcd(n,k))/phi(n/gcd(n,k)). Similarly,
  Sum_{n>=1} a(n)/n! = 1.954085357876006213144... This sum is referenced in Plouffe's inverter. - _Alexander R. Povolotsky_, Feb 02 2013 (see A336334. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Jul 22 2020)
  Suppose that a and n are coprime positive integers, then by Euler's totient theorem, any factor of n divides a^phi(n) - 1. - _Lei Zhou_, Feb 28 2012
  The order of the multiplicative group of units modulo n. - _Michael Somos_, Aug 27 2013
  Use of gcd(n,k)*lcm(n,k) = n*k and phi(gcd(n,k))*phi(lcm(n,k)) = phi(n)*phi(k) provide further variations. (End)
  a(n) equals the Jordan function J_1(n) (cf. A007434, A059376, A059377, which are the Jordan functions J_2, J_3, J_4, respectively). (End)
  a(n) equals the Ramanujan sum c_n(n) (last term on n-th row of triangle A054533).
  a(n) is the highest degree of irreducible polynomial dividing 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^(n-1) = (x^n - 1)/(x - 1). - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Sep 02 2006, corrected Sep 27 2006
  a(n) is the minimum dimension of a lattice able to generate, via cut-and-project, the quasilattice whose diffraction pattern features n-fold rotational symmetry. The case n=15 is the first n > 1 in which the following simpler definition fails: "a(n) is the minimum dimension of a lattice with n-fold rotational symmetry". - _Felix Flicker_, Nov 08 2017
  a(n) is the number of rational numbers p/q >= 0 (in lowest terms) such that p + q = n. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Jan 17 2021
  a(n+1) is the number of binary words with exactly n distinct subsequences (when n > 0). - _Radoslaw Zak_, Nov 29 2021
  a(n+2) equals the number of palindromic Sturmian words of length n which are "bispecial", prefix or suffix of two Sturmian words of length n + 1. - _Fred Lunnon_, Sep 05 2010
  a(p) = p - 1 for prime p. a(n) is even for n > 2. For n > 2, a(n)/2 = A023022(n) = number of partitions of n into 2 ordered relatively prime parts. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Jan 25 2007
